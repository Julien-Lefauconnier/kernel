# kernel

This repository contains a **minimal cognitive kernel**.

It is **not** an operating system kernel.

The kernel provides:
- immutable signals
- append-only journals
- strict temporal guarantees
- explicit input/output ports

It contains **no business logic**, **no infrastructure**, and **no interpretation**.

Its purpose is to serve as a stable, distributable core for higher-level cognitive systems.
